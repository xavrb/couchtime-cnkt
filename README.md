# What is couch Time 

We all at some point ever wanted to log every movie we liked -- wether you are a fan of Back to the future or maybe Silence of the lambs, even Twilight (no judgement here), it doesn't matter -- so we can talk to our friends on the next party or just to collect watched movies. Enter Couch Time.  
It’s a simple API and implementation developed in Python Django as a proof of concept  — a technical test, where an user can log their fav movies.
